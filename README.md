# Project Title: AgriMitra: Smart Agricultural Advisory and Monitoring System
--- 
# Project Abstract: 

* Agrimitra is a digital platform that combines AI-driven insights with IoT-powered monitoring to help farmers make smarter, sustainable decisions. Think of it as your friendly farm co-pilot! It continuously tracks soil health, weather conditions, and crop status, delivering real-time advisories and alerts for optimized irrigation, early pest and disease detection, and efficient resource usage. Always watching, always learning, and always ready with practical recommendations.

## * Key Features

*   **Real-time Sensor Monitoring:** Keeps an eye on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light, and local weather data.
*   **AI-powered Crop Health Analysis:** Predicts disease risks and provides actionable alerts to keep your crops happy.
*   **Optimized Irrigation:** Smart scheduling and control to ensure plants get just the right amount of water.
*   **Early Pest & Disease Detection:** Get prevention and treatment guidance before issues escalate.
*   **Automated Recommendations:** Resource-efficient farming made easy with intelligent suggestions.
*   **Urban Farming Support:** Special guidance for Aeroponic Towers, complete with crop-specific instructions.
*   **Garden Planning Tools:** Visual allocation and planting suggestions for your home garden.
*   **Robotic Planting Arm:** Automates seed placement and spacing for efficiency.
*   **System Status Dashboard:** End-to-end visibility of all devices and operations at a glance.

## * Hackathon Deliverables (IEEE Innoquest)

For the IEEE Innoquest hackathon, we plan to deliver:

*   **Demo-ready Web Interface** featuring:
    *   New Farmers, Urban Farming, and Gardening modules.
    *   Crop info, lifecycle videos, disease risks, and solutions.
    *   Garden Planner inputs and visual outputs.
    *   Automation Control Panel (start/stop robotic arm, irrigation, status dashboard).
*   **Pitch Assets:**
    *   PowerPoint Presentation.

## * System Architecture Overview

Agrimitra is built on two main pillars that work seamlessly together:

### Web Application (Advisory, Planning, and Control)

This is the farmer's command center!
*   **Farmer-friendly interfaces** for crop selection, growth simulations, garden planning, and automation control.
*   **Educational modules** packed with lifecycle videos, disease risks, and solutions.
*   **Real-time dashboards** pulling live data from all your sensors and devices.

## * Project Workflow

### Web Technologies (Website)

#### **New Farmers Section**
*   **Crop Selection:** Guided choices for soil or aeroponic setups.
*   **Disease Risk:** Forecasts and alerts to stay ahead of problems.
*   **Crop Simulation:** Visualize growth stages and project yield.

#### **Urban Farming Section (Aeroponic Tower)**
*   **Introduction:** Get started with aeroponics.
*   **How to Use:** Step-by-step guides.
*   **Crop Type:** Horizontal buttons for popular crops like:
    *   Tomato
    *   Brinjal
    *   Chili
    *   ...and more!
    *   For each crop: Detailed info, lifecycle video, common disease risks, and solutions.

#### **Gardening Section**
*   **Garden Planning:**
    *   Input garden dimensions (length × width).
    *   Specify % of area for each desired crop.
    *   Enter the number of crops to be planted.
*   **Crop Type:** Similar to urban farming, with buttons for:
    *   Tomato
    *   Brinjal
    *   Chili
    *   ...and more!
    *   For each crop: Info, lifecycle video, disease risks, and solutions.

#### **Automation Control Panel**
*   **Start/Stop Robotic Arm:** Direct control over planting operations.
*   **Irrigation Control:** Manage your watering schedules.


## Tech Stack (Indicative)

Here's a peek at the technologies powering Agrimitra:

*   **Frontend:** `Tailwind`, `Bootstrap`, `CSS` (for sleek UIs), video embedding for rich content.
*   **Backend:** `FastAPI`, `Pydantic`, `PyMongo`, `MongoDB`, `CORPS(FastAPI Middleware)` (for real-time updates).
*   **IoT:** `ESP8266`, various sensor suites (moisture, DHT, light), `MQTT/HTTP` for communication.
*   **Robotics:** Stepper/servo motors, kinematics control, path planning routines.
*   **Visualization:** Charts for sensor trends, interactive maps for layout planning, clear alert banners.
